# Yes-Kill
A prototype RPG, created for CSC 599 in Fall 2021 for Creighton University.

You and your companions have been chosen to take part in a game show titled "Yes!!! KILL!!!!" This show, run by a cult devoted to the elder god Ya'Skiel, welcomes on contestants for one purpose: to offer sacrifices to their god. Those who win will get their heart's desire granted to them... for a price...

With your life in jeopardy, and the wheel of fortune spinning towards an unfortunate fate, will you press your luck and achieve victory?

The soundtrack is not included. The files will go in "Soundtrack," as "battlenormal.wav" and "kitsuneboss.wav"
